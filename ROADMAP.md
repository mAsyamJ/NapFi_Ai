# NapFi AI: Intelligent Cross-Chain Yield Optimizer

This roadmap outlines our development journey from hackathon prototype to full production release of NapFi AI - a DeFi protocol leveraging artificial intelligence to automatically route user funds to the most profitable and secure yield opportunities across multiple blockchains.

## Phase 0: Hackathon Implementation (2-3 days)

Our hackathon implementation will demonstrate the core concept with a functional prototype on a single blockchain.

### Scope
- Single blockchain (Polygon testnet)
- 2 yield protocols (Aave and Compound)
- Single asset type (USDC)
- Rule-based allocation system simulating AI decision-making
- Basic UI with deposit/withdraw functionality

### Deliverables
1. **Smart Contracts**
   - Basic vault contract for deposits/withdrawals
   - Strategy connectors for 2 protocols
   - Simple allocator with basic optimization logic

2. **Data & Decision Logic**
   - Yield data fetcher for real-time APY information
   - Rule-based allocation algorithm
   - Performance tracking for demonstration

3. **Frontend**
   - Minimal UI for deposit/withdraw
   - Wallet integration (MetaMask)
   - Basic dashboard showing allocation and yields

4. **Demo & Presentation**
   - Working demo on testnet
   - Presentation explaining the concept and future vision

## Phase 1: MVP Development (2-3 months)
